## TLDR

Organizations should maintain a single stack-ranked priority list instead of multiple competing roadmaps and P0 backlogs. The discomfort of forcing a ranking is exactly the hard prioritization work that leaders have been avoiding.

## Key Takeaways

- The word "priority" was singular for 500 years until the 1900s; pluralizing it gave us permission to avoid deciding what truly comes first
- A single ordered list is a forcing function: no ties allowed, moving something up means moving something else down, and everyone sees the consequences
- PayPal (Thiel's one-thing rule), Amazon (single-threaded leadership), and Apple (Jobs cutting 70% of products) all succeeded through radical focus on a single prioritized list
- Without a single list, organizations develop silos, peanut-buttered engineers, and decision fatigue from constant resource negotiations
- The discomfort you feel when forcing a ranking is the same discomfort you've been avoiding by letting everything be equally important

## Summary

The article explores one of the most powerful forcing functions available to leaders: a single prioritized list, stack ranked from top to bottom with no ties allowed. Most organizations instead operate with multiple competing roadmaps, parallel backlogs, and collections of P0 initiatives demanding equal attention, leading to silos, politics, and teams that are perpetually busy but rarely finishing anything.

Drawing from Greg McKeown's "Essentialism," the author notes that the word "priority" was singular for five hundred years, meaning the very first thing. Only in the 1900s did we pluralize it, giving ourselves permission to avoid the hard work of truly deciding what comes first. Multiple priorities let leaders avoid uncomfortable conversations about why one team's initiative sits below another, and avoid confronting what they're willing to sacrifice.

Three high-profile examples illustrate the power of the single list: Peter Thiel at PayPal insisted each person could only do one thing and refused to discuss anything else; Amazon's single-threaded leadership model dedicated Steve Kessel entirely to Kindle (leaving 77% of revenue behind) and Andy Jassy entirely to AWS; Steve Jobs returned to Apple and cut 70% of products to focus on just four computers. The common thread is leaders willing to make hard choices and live with consequences.

Without a single list, organizations develop predictable symptoms: silos form as teams optimize for their own backlogs, engineers get "peanut buttered" across too many projects, and decision fatigue sets in from constant negotiations. The article closes with a practical exercise: list everything, force a ranking with no ties, notice where you hesitate (that's where the real prioritization work lives), and share the list with peers. The companies that move fastest aren't those with the most resources; they're the ones that know what comes first.
